# Neural Translation Model
The objective is to develop a neural translation model from English to German, utilizing a pre-trained English word embedding module.

This notebook project creates a neural network that translates from English to German. It incorporates concepts such as building flexible model architectures, freezing layers, data processing pipelines, and sequence modeling.

A language dataset from [manythings.org](http://www.manythings.org/anki/) is used for this project. This dataset comprises over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German.

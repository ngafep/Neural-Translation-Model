# Neural Translation Model
This notebook project will create a neural network that translates from English to German. It will utilize concepts such as building flexible model architectures, freezing layers, data processing pipelines, and sequence modeling.

A language dataset from http://www.manythings.org/anki/ will be used for this project to build a neural translation model. This dataset comprises over 200,000 pairs of sentences in English and German. To expedite training, the dataset will be restricted to 20,000 pairs. This restriction can be altered as desired; the dataset size used is not considered in the grading rubric.

The objective is to develop a neural translation model from English to German, utilizing a pre-trained English word embedding module.
